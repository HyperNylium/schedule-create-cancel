## description
Just like Tkinter's .after() event where you can run a function after x amount of milliseconds, this does the same thing but you can use this for normal .py files, Tkinter and CustomTkinter. One feature is that you can cancel a function call just using the function name instead of the ID. And for normal files, its more useful for discord.py and you can run either async or normal functions after x amounts of seconds (for Tkinter and CustomTkinter the time function is milliseconds but for normal files its seconds)
